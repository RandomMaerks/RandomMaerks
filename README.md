## 'lo there

i certainly don't need fancy graphics to display my unproductiveness in fancy ways, and i certainly don't need grammar

so here are some things you can know about me. you don't need to, but you can:

- my username has been and will always be one whole word. the "ae" is two letters. "maerks" is pronounced like "marks", but you feel slightly more posh after saying it. why? i dont know. go ask my 2020 self or something
- apparently my github account was created on the 16th of july, 2022
- no, i don't know anything about coding
- i have the money to buy fontlab but i don't. because screw my sanity and not screw my bank account, i love enduring pain and i don't want to be penniless
- i don't work on a set schedule. my work hours are from `i-need:to-work` to `that's-enough-for:today`
- i have the ability to write with proper grammar and advanced vocabulary. i just choose not to do it anyway

that is all !
