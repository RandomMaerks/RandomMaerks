## helo :]

i certainly don't need fancy graphics to display my unproductiveness in fancy ways, and i certainly don't need grammar

so here are some things you can know about me. you don't need to, but you can:

- my username has been and will always be one whole word. the "ae" is two letters. "maerks" is pronounced like "marks", but you feel slightly more posh after saying it. why? i dont know. go ask my 2020 self or something
- apparently my github account was created on the 16th of july, 2022
- no, i don't know anything about coding (update 11 feb 2026: ok maybe coding is not so bad after all)
- i use fontforge even though it sucks because I AM SO USED TO IT AND CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT (update 11 feb 2026: i was convinced to use fontlab)
- i work whenever i feel like working
- i have the ability to write with proper grammar and advanced vocabulary. i just choose not to do it anyway
- I have no reason to hide my unprofessionalism. lol

i've also decided to add some things so people can quickly see my projects:
